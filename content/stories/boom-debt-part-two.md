# **BOOM DEBT: PART TWO**

## **A Fanhattan Story — Casa de Boom #3**

Shep's Bar smelled like honest failure.

Not the dramatic kind. Not the kind that makes good television or better songs. The quiet kind: spilled beer soaked into wood grain over forty years, nicotine ghosts haunting the walls from before the smoking ban, the particular funk of a building that had survived everything Fanhattan could throw at it and decided, on balance, that a fresh coat of paint wasn't worth the trouble.

Papi sat in the back booth at 10:47 PM with a café con leche he hadn't ordered. Shep had set it down without asking, the way a bartender does when he knows your nerves are shot and your hands need something to hold.

"Billy's coming," Shep said. "Five minutes."

"I know."

"You look like hell."

"Papi always looks like hell, Shepherd. It is part of my charm."

The showman's voice. Running on fumes. Shep gave him a look that said he wasn't fooled and walked back to the bar, where three old regulars nursed their drinks like medicine.

Stadium South at night had a particular quality that La Fiesta never managed: stillness. Not peace, exactly. More like a held breath. Eight blocks of brick and brown and gray that had learned, over decades, that the safest thing to do was sit quiet and wait for whatever was coming to pass through without breaking anything important.

Papi envied that. La Fiesta couldn't hold its breath if you paid it to.

The front door opened. A man walked in wearing a brown paper bag over his head.

If you'd never seen Brown Bag Billy, you'd assume it was a joke. Some drunk playing dress-up, some local character who'd lost a bet. But Papi had lived in Fanhattan long enough to know the difference between a costume and a statement, and Billy's bag was the second thing. Eye holes cut clean. Paper creased sharp. The bag said: *I am exactly what you think I am, and I dare you to make something of it.*

Billy slid into the booth across from Papi. No handshake. No greeting. He set a canvas messenger bag on the table, unlatched it, and pulled out a tablet so cracked it looked like it had been used as a cutting board.

"Show me," Billy said.

His voice was younger than Papi expected. Quieter, too. Not the voice of a legend. The voice of someone who'd learned that speaking softly meant people leaned in to listen.

Papi set the three items on the table between their drinks. The brass key. The glass vial. The wax-sealed letter. Each one wrapped in a torn piece of piñata shell, the inside surface marked with those three symbols: circle with a line, square with a dot, ouroboros.

Billy studied them without touching. His eyes, barely visible through the bag's cutouts, moved with the deliberate patience of someone who'd trained himself to see things other people missed.

"Where did you find these?"

"Inside three of my piñatas. High-tier. Someone opened them, planted the items, marked the shells, and resealed them. Whoever did it got past my wards."

"Your probability wards."

"Yes."

Billy picked up the piñata fragment. Held it to the bar's dim light. Tilted it. The symbols caught the overhead neon in a way that made them look almost wet.

"These aren't Syndicate distribution markers," Billy said.

Papi blinked. "No?"

"These are probability sigils. Washing tags." Billy set the fragment down, pulled up something on his cracked tablet, and turned the screen toward Papi. A diagram: concentric circles, symbols mapped to probability wavelengths, arrows showing energy flow. "The Resistance has been tracking these for eight months. We've found them on smuggled goods, currency bundles, even people. The Syndicate stamps items with these sigils, then routes them through a high-belief environment. The belief energy saturates the sigil, and the item comes out the other side clean."

"Clean how?"

"Untrackable. The Resistance has probability scanners; Bailey built most of them. We can trace any object that's been touched by Syndicate probability manipulation. Their apparatus leaves a signature, like a fingerprint. But items washed through a natural belief field lose that signature entirely. The fingerprint gets scrubbed."

Papi's stomach dropped.

"Someone is using my piñatas as washing machines."

"Someone is using your *smash sessions* as washing machines. The items go in before the session. The crowd generates belief energy. The piñata breaks. The energy saturates everything inside. The items come out clean." Billy leaned back. "It's elegant. Your shop generates some of the densest natural belief fields in Fanhattan. Higher than most stadium events. Higher than anything the Proving Grounds produces. A single smash session in Casa de Boom could wash a dozen items in thirty seconds."

Papi thought about Lucia. The way the Mythic piñata had cracked in three hits. The way it had practically *thrown* itself open.

"The piñata broke too fast," Papi said. "A Mythic, three swings. That's impossible."

"Not if the threshold was modified. Whoever tampered with it could've weakened the seal. Made it fragile on purpose so the session would be short and intense. Maximum belief energy, minimum exposure time." Billy paused. "Whoever's doing this understands your craft, Papi. This isn't a street-level operative stuffing contraband into a cardboard box. This is someone who can manipulate probability thresholds."

The café con leche had gone cold. Papi hadn't touched it.

"Three employees," he said. "Tomás, Yolanda, Danny. One of them has the access and the skill."

"Don't confront anyone." Billy's voice hardened; not aggressive, but final. The voice of a man who'd learned the cost of tipping your hand too early. "We need the network, not just the mole. If you spook them, the Syndicate pulls out, rebuilds somewhere else, and we lose eight months of tracking."

"They're framing me, Billy. Those two operatives said they 'appreciated my cooperation.' If this goes public, I look dirty."

"I know. That's why we do this right." Billy reached into his messenger bag and pulled out three small discs, each the size of a dime, translucent, almost invisible. "Probability trackers. Bailey's design. Embed one in each of the two remaining tampered piñatas. When the Syndicate retrieves them, we follow the signal. It leads us up the chain."

Papi took the discs. They weighed nothing. Felt like glass, warm to the touch; a distant cousin of the stone he'd put inside the ugly piñata, though thinner and more refined.

"And the mole?"

"Watch. Don't act. When we're ready to move on the network, we take the mole too. But not before."

Papi stared at the three items on the table. The key, the vial, the letter. Three objects that had lived inside his piñatas, been washed clean by the joy of his customers, and were now sitting in Shep's bar waiting to be claimed by people whose intentions he couldn't guess.

"One condition," Papi said.

Billy waited.

"When you find out who it is, I get to hear it from them. Face to face. In my shop. Before anything else happens."

Billy studied him for a long moment through those cut paper eyes.

"Okay."

They shook hands.

The next three days were the longest of Papi's life.

He opened the shop at 9 AM. Showman smile. Big voice. Churros on the counter, music on the speaker, streamers catching the Calle Rota breeze through the open roll-up door. He greeted customers, hyped smash sessions, clapped his hands and called out "¡Fiesta!" when piñatas broke, and not a single person in Casa de Boom could've told you that the man behind the counter was watching his own employees like a hawk counting chickens.

Tomás worked the stockroom. Same as always. Quiet. Efficient. Moved piñatas from the back shelves to the display with a careful precision that Papi had always admired and now found himself scrutinizing for signs of something else. Did his hands linger on certain piñatas? Did he favor the high-tier shelf? Did his route through the stockroom take him past the back room door, where the ugly piñata still hummed behind its lock?

Nothing. Tomás worked the way Tomás always worked: competent, invisible, done.

Yolanda ran the register. Loud. Fast. Told a customer from The Proving Grounds that he swung a bat "like a man trying to kill a mosquito with a phone book," which made the whole shop laugh and the customer buy three more sessions out of spite. She counted Scraps, restocked the candy display, and spent her lunch break on the phone arguing with her sister about a telenovela plot twist.

Nothing unusual. Nothing hidden.

Danny swept floors. Restocked tissue paper. Carried boxes. Said "yes sir" and "no sir" and otherwise kept his mouth closed. He was good at being invisible, which Papi had once found endearing and now found suspicious, though he hated himself for the suspicion.

The kid was nineteen. From the docks. No family. Good hands.

Every ex-con, every hustler, every stray Papi had ever known had started with the same resume.

On the second day, Papi built a trap.

He constructed a new Epic-tier piñata during closing hours, after the staff had gone home. Standard build: wire frame, tissue layers, paste, stuffing. But he left the final seal incomplete. A small gap in the bottom seam, invisible to the eye but obvious to anyone with the tingle. An invitation. A door left unlocked on purpose.

He shelved it in the premium section, next to the two remaining tampered piñatas. Then he embedded one of Bailey's probability trackers in the wet paste of the shelf bracket, pointed at the new piñata like a security camera made of glass and intention.

Then he went home and didn't sleep.

6:12 AM. Papi's phone buzzed.

A text from a number he didn't recognize. No words. Just a photograph: the trap piñata, still on its shelf, taken from inside the stockroom. The angle was low, close; someone had been standing right next to it.

Whoever sent the photo knew about the trap.

Papi sat on the edge of his bed, heart hammering, staring at the screen. The photo told him three things. First: the mole had spotted the incomplete seal. Second: the mole knew it was deliberate. Third: the mole was telling Papi they knew.

Not hiding. Not running.

Communicating.

He drove to the shop in twelve minutes, four minutes faster than usual because he ran two lights and a stop sign that existed more as a suggestion than a rule in La Fiesta anyway. He unlocked the front door, walked past the displays, and went straight to the premium shelf.

The trap piñata was still there. Untampered. The incomplete seal was exactly as he'd left it.

But inside, resting on top of the candy and shards, was a folded piece of paper that hadn't been there last night.

He pulled it out. Unfolded it.

Handwriting he recognized.

Tomás.

The note said:

*I know you're looking. I'm sorry. They have my sister. I can explain everything but not here. Not in the shop. The walls have ears and it isn't just me.*

Papi read the note three times. His hands were steady, which surprised him. He'd expected shaking, anger; the hot flush of betrayal that comes when you learn someone you trusted has been lying. What he felt instead was colder and worse: the slow understanding that this was bigger than one mole in one shop.

*It isn't just me.*

Two of them. Maybe all three. Maybe the whole staff was compromised, and Papi had been the only honest person in his own building for months.

Or maybe Tomás was lying. Maybe the note was another frame, another layer of the same operation that had put "we appreciate your cooperation" in the mouth of a Syndicate accountant.

Papi folded the note. Put it in his pocket. Stood in his shop at 6:30 in the morning, surrounded by piñatas and streamers and the ghosts of eleven thousand celebrations, and tried to figure out which version of reality he was living in.

Behind the locked door, the ugly piñata hummed.

It had been humming all week: low, constant, almost ignorable. Background noise. Papi had trained himself to tune it out the way you tune out a refrigerator or a neighbor's TV. But this morning the tone was different. Higher. Sharper. An urgency that plucked at the tingle like a finger on a guitar string.

Papi walked to the back room door. Pressed his palm against it.

The humming shifted. Dropped. Rose. Dropped again. A pattern. Not random; *responsive*. Reacting to his touch the way a dog reacts to its owner's hand.

He almost opened the door.

Almost.

His phone buzzed again. Same unknown number. Another photo: Papi himself, standing at the back room door with his palm pressed flat. Taken from inside the shop.

Someone was in the building with him.

Papi spun around. The shop was empty. Roll-up door still down. Front door locked; he'd locked it behind him. The stockroom door was closed. The windows were papered over with old flyers and festival posters, the way they'd been for years.

No one.

But the photo was real. Timestamped 6:31 AM. Taken from the direction of the register, about fifteen feet away, at eye level.

He walked to the register. Looked behind it. Under it. Checked the shelves, the displays, the streamers.

Nothing.

Then he saw it.

On the counter, next to the churro tray, sitting in plain sight like it had always been there: a small brass key. Identical to the one Lucia had pulled from the tampered piñata four days ago.

Papi picked it up.

Warm.

His phone buzzed a third time. Same number. This time, text:

*The key fits the lock on the door you're afraid to open. She wants to help you, Alejandro. But you have to let her.*

Alejandro.

His birth name. Again. The name the ugly piñata had spoken into his skull on the seventh night. The name nobody in Fanhattan knew.

Except, apparently, whoever was sending these messages.

Papi looked at the key in his hand. Looked at the back room door. The humming behind it had risen to a pitch he could feel in his collarbones, a vibration that made the streamers tremble and the piñatas on the wall sway like congregation members catching the spirit.

The key was warm and getting warmer.

The door was six steps away.

*She wants to help you.*

She.

The piñata. The ugly, lopsided, lumpy piñata he'd built in a thunderstorm. The piñata that had spoken his name. The piñata that had no threshold, no bottom, no limit that his tingle could find.

She.

Papi looked at the key. Looked at the door.

Behind him, somewhere in the empty shop, a floorboard creaked. The sound of weight shifting. The sound of someone who had been standing very, very still for a very long time.

Papi didn't turn around.

"Tomás," he said.

Silence.

"I read your note."

More silence. Then, from behind the register, quiet enough that Papi had to strain: "They're watching the shop, Papi. Cameras. I found three of them last month; there could be more. Everything you do in here, they see."

Papi closed his eyes. Syndicate cameras. In *his* shop. In the place he'd built with his own hands, where the paste was still under his fingernails and the streamers still held the echo of every cheer and every laugh and every *boom* he'd given this city for thirty-one years.

"The key," Papi said.

"I don't know where it came from. It wasn't me."

"Then who?"

Tomás stepped out from behind the register. He looked like he hadn't slept in weeks. Dark circles, hollow cheeks, the hunted expression of a man caught between two things that could destroy him.

"That's what I've been trying to figure out." He nodded toward the back room door. "But I think she knows."

The humming surged. Golden light leaked from under the door, thin and warm, painting their shoes and the floor and the base of the counter in patterns that, if you looked long enough, almost resolved into something readable.

Almost.

Papi held up the key.

"If I open that door," he said, "I don't think I can close it again."

Tomás looked at him. The kid's eyes were red. His hands were shaking. Whatever the Syndicate had on his sister, whatever leverage they'd used to turn a quiet, reliable stockroom worker into a probability smuggler, it was eating him from the inside.

"Papi," Tomás said. "I don't think it was ever closed."

The golden light pulsed.

The humming found a new note: low, resonant, patient. The sound of something ancient settling into its final position. The sound of a lock waiting for its key.

Papi looked at the door.

Six steps.

He took the first one.
