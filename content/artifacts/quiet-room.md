## What It Is

The Quiet Room is a circular parlor on the second floor of the Birchingham Club. It looks like a rich person's sitting room. It behaves like a trap.

## What It Does

The longer you stay, the harder it gets to lie. The effect escalates from discomfort to compulsion, as if the room is feeding on confession.
