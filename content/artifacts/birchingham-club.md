## Overview

The Birchingham Club is an old-money Winchester institution with a membership fee designed to keep the city out. It hosts charity events, backroom deals, and the annual poker tournament that quietly reshapes power.

## The Quiet Room

The club's second-floor parlor, the Quiet Room, is the real reason people whisper about the place. Stay long enough and lies start to hurt.
