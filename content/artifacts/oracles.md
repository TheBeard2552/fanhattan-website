## Definition

Oracles are people whose probability sense goes beyond the tingle. Some can see the field directly, as threads of light. Some can read it like weather.

## Why They Matter

The Syndicate hunts them because an Oracle makes belief measurable. The Resistance protects them because an Oracle makes the city's manipulation visible.
