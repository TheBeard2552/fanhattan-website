# Sylvia Pratt

Winchester's Director of Community Relations is a title that didn't exist three weeks ago, and Sylvia Pratt is the woman they invented it for. She coordinated the Open House, managed the carpet runners over the sidewalk-free district, and smiled her way through a PR event that was secretly a Syndicate surveillance operation she had no idea about until it was too late. Sylvia grew up in Cabot's Landing. She married into Winchester. She works harder than anyone to prove she belongs, but the private truth is that she doesn't want to belong at all. She wants to run. When a twelve-year-old girl in a Bengals hoodie set off every sensor on the tour route, and two men in dark suits went very, very quiet, Sylvia's Cabot's Landing instincts kicked back in. She remembers what it feels like to be powerless. Running from Winchester is harder than running to it, but protecting an innocent kid might be the thing that finally makes her move.
