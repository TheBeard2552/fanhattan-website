  Legit dealer who knows his cards and sports history. Played ball back in the

  South.

  Every authentic card he sells is a middle finger to the Syndicate who burned
  down his uncle's shop. He's terrified they'll make an example of him next.

## What They Want

To run his business clean in a dirty city, and to honor the game that gave him everything—even if his career ended before the pros. Every authentic card he sells, every collector he helps, is a way of keeping that connection alive.

## What Stands In Their Way

The Syndicate-affiliated memorabilia shops that deal in fakes and stolen goods. The fact that "honest card dealer" sounds like an oxymoron to most people. His bum knee from his final college game—a constant reminder of what could have been.

## What They're Willing to Risk

He already risked his safety by refusing to sell fakes or deal with Syndicate suppliers. He already risked his profits by insisting on authentication and fair prices. At this point, Terry's all-in on his principles. If they kill him for it, at least he'll die knowing he didn't compromise.

## Reputation (Street Truth)

"Touchdown Terry? Yeah, he's legit. Like, actually legit. Knows his cards, knows his sports history. You bring him something, he'll tell you straight if it's real or fake, what it's worth. Played ball back in the day—still got the limp to prove it. It's weird having an honest dealer in Stadium South, but he's been at it for years, so I guess it works?"

People genuinely can't figure out if Terry's a saint or an idiot. The consensus leans toward "both, and that's why we like him."

## Private Truth

He's not doing this out of pure altruism. Terry's uncle ran a memorabilia shop that got burned down in the '90s during a Syndicate territory grab. The loss destroyed his uncle—not just financially, but spiritually. Watching cards and jerseys that meant something go up in flames because some gangster wanted protection money... it changed Terry.

He inherited what was left and rebuilt with one rule: never compromise. Every authentic card he sells is a middle finger to the Syndicate. Every collector he treats fairly is proof that you don't have to be dirty to survive.

But he's also terrified. Because he knows the second the Syndicate decides he's more trouble than he's worth, they'll make an example of him just like they did to his uncle.
