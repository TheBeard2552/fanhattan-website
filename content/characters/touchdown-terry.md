# Touchdown Terry

Touchdown Terry runs the only honest card shop on Greer Avenue, and in Stadium South, that's practically a superpower. Former athlete turned small businessman, Terry has spent twenty years proving that you don't have to be dirty to survive in Fanhattan's roughest district. His shop is where Nate Fontaine works, where collectors trade above board, and where the sports history of this city gets preserved one card at a time. Cecil Fontaine saved Terry's shop from Syndicate shakedowns back in 2009 by making a single phone call to someone in Winchester, and the shakedowns stopped overnight. Terry never knew who Cecil called. Now, reading the ledger, he's starting to understand. When the Syndicate sent operatives to his shop after hours, they stole his bat and killed his security camera. Terry would burn the whole shop down before he'd let them bury a twenty-three-year-old kid inside it.
