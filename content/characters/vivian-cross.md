# Vivian Cross

Forensic accountant, Bailey Brownbag's college roommate, and the woman who won the Quiet Room poker tournament with a probability tracker sewn into her blazer lining. Vivian's first field assignment for the Resistance was supposed to be simple: sit at a card table, follow the money, collect names. The Quiet Room had other plans. By the seventh hour, the truth-compulsion field was pulling confessions out of Winchester's elite like loose threads, and Vivian realized it was working on her too. The truth she was fighting to hold back had nothing to do with the Resistance. Three years ago, she embezzled forty thousand dollars from a client to pay for her mother's surgery. If that comes out, she's done. Professionally, legally, personally. She won the names. Then Press Vandermeer locked the door and said nobody leaves until they've all told their last truth. Vivian's response: "Fine. But you go first." They're still in that room.
