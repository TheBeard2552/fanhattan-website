# Cecil Fontaine

Cecil Fontaine trimmed Winchester's hedges for forty-one years, and in all that time, the district's elite never once considered that the invisible man with the garden shears might be listening. He was furniture. He was the lawnmower. And every night, he went home and wrote it all down in a leather-bound ledger titled "What the Hedges Heard, 1984-2025." Syndicate payments, affairs, backroom deals, the real reason the hospital closed. What nobody knew, not even his own family, was that Cecil was a Brownbag intelligence asset, recruited in 1984 by Bailey's great-uncle. He reported to the Resistance for four decades without saying a word to his grandson, his daughter, or anyone else with his last name. His final entry reads: "The city keeps score. I was just the pencil." Cecil died on a Wednesday in his sleep, and left behind the most dangerous document in Winchester.
