# Lucia Vega

Twenty-two, bruised eye, army jacket, and ten thousand Scraps poorer. Lucia Vega walked into Casa de Boom and paid for a private smash session, which is not the kind of thing that happens in La Fiesta without someone noticing. What she pulled from that piñata was a brass key, and the piñata she pulled it from had been tampered with, opened, marked with Syndicate sigils, and resealed before she ever touched it. Lucia is acting under duress, that much is obvious. Who's pulling her strings, and what the brass key opens, are questions that currently have no answers. She's at large in Fanhattan, carrying a key to something the Syndicate wants badly enough to compromise Papi's shop. Whatever she's running from is worse than whatever she's running toward.
