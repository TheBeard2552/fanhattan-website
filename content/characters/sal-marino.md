# Sal Marino

Sal Marino is the kind of man who'll buy you a drink and then break your arm if you spill it on his shoes, and he'll do both with the same professionalism. Former mob enforcer, independent operator, and Cecil Fontaine's oldest friend, Sal runs his business in Stadium South the old-fashioned way: with a code, a gun, and debts that get paid. The Syndicate pushed the mob out years ago, and most people don't even remember there was a mob. Sal remembers. When Cecil's grandson Nate inherited the most dangerous document in Winchester, Sal decided the kid was going to survive whether he wanted to or not, because Sal Marino pays his debts and Cecil saved his ass in '93. What terrifies Sal isn't dying. It's being forgotten. If he can keep the kid alive and deliver the ledger, maybe someone will remember Sal Marino as more than muscle.
