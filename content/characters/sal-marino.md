  Terrified of being forgotten. The mob got pushed out by the Syndicate, and

## What They Want

Respect. Not fear—he had that, and it didn't stick. Respect. The kind that comes from being good at what you do and keeping your word. Also, he wouldn't mind if the old Italian mob made a comeback and he got to be part of that resurgence. But mostly respect.

## What Stands In Their Way

Age. The fact that his glory days are behind him. The fact that the Syndicate displaced the mob and turned guys like him into relics. The fact that helping Billy might be the last relevant thing he ever does, and he's not sure if that's tragic or perfect.

## What They're Willing to Risk

His life, obviously. Sal's got a death wish, but it's a professional death wish—he wants to go out doing something that matters, not rotting in a nursing home. If Billy's cause gives him that exit, he'll take it.

## Reputation (Street Truth)

"Sal? Old-school. Dangerous back in the day, probably still dangerous now if you're stupid enough to test him. Runs odds, moves packages, doesn't ask questions, doesn't snitch. You can trust him if he gives his word, but don't mistake professionalism for friendship."

The older generation remembers when Sal was the enforcer for the mob's Stadium South operations. The younger generation just sees an old guy who talks too much about bocce.

## Private Truth

He's terrified of being forgotten. Not killed—forgotten. The mob got pushed out by the Syndicate, and most people don't even remember there was a mob. Sal remembers. He remembers when they ran this city with honor, with rules, with standards.

The Syndicate's just chaos wearing a suit. No respect for the old ways. Helping Billy isn't just about taking down the Syndicate. It's about proving that the old ways still matter. That guys like Sal aren't obsolete.
