# Elena Vandermeer

Press Vandermeer's daughter is smarter than her father, colder than her father, and unlike her father, she plans ahead. Real estate attorney by trade, Elena secured the demolition permits for Morrow's Manor because her father's signature appears on too many Syndicate documents to risk public appearances. She wants the Manor gone, the land developed, and the profits laundered into clean money that distances the Vandermeer name from everything Press built. What her father doesn't know: Elena found his Syndicate ledger three years ago. She didn't destroy it. She copied it. She's been waiting for the right moment to deploy it, not out of justice, but out of leverage. In Winchester, even the family knives are monogrammed.
