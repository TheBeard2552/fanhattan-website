# Papi

Papi runs Casa de Boom on Calle Rota—the premier piñata shop in La Fiesta. He's been building piñatas for thirty-one years; eleven thousand, give or take. He hums when he works. He turns confusion into excitement. His smile is load-bearing.

## The Crafter

Every piñata crafter worth a damn can feel probability fields. Papi feels them better than most. He's explained this to four people. Three looked at him like he was describing how to milk a cloud. The fourth was Bailey Brownbag—she nodded and took notes.

## Casa de Boom

The shop is neutral ground. Big Reina, Marco from the taquería, lookie-loos from Meadow Hills, buskers from The Bayou—everyone comes through. Papi treats them all the same. Showman on the surface. Serious when it matters.

## What He's Built

The unbreakable piñata changed everything. Something inside it spoke his real name—Alejandro—a name nobody in La Fiesta had used in decades. He called Bailey. He called Billy. Whatever woke up in that piñata, it's been waiting a long time to talk.
