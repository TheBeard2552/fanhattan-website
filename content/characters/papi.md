# Piñata Papi

His name is Alejandro. Nobody in Fanhattan knows that, and he'd like to keep it that way. To the seven blocks of La Fiesta, he's Papi, the 63-year-old piñata craftsman who built Casa de Boom from nothing and turned celebration into the district's religion. Thirty-one years. Eleven thousand piñatas. A "tingle" behind his molars that tells him when the probability field is right. He hums when he builds, a sound nobody can record and nobody can explain, and the piñatas he creates do things that piñatas aren't supposed to do. He's got two modes: Showman Papi, the manic charmer who calls everyone "amigo" and claps like he's keeping time with the universe, and Serious Papi, the flat-voiced, short-sentenced version that makes grown men back toward the exit. His hands shake now. He has no apprentice. And the ugly piñata in the back of the shop just said his birth name into his mind, which means something very old knows something nobody should.
