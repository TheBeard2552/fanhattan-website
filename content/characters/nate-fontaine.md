# Nate Fontaine

Twenty-three years old, part-time card shop employee, full-time inheritor of a dead man's secrets. Nate Fontaine found his grandfather Cecil's ledger in a bedside table and went from "good kid, nothing special" to the most hunted person in Winchester overnight. Three factions want the book: the Resistance says it's theirs by right, the Syndicate needs to burn the pages that name their operatives, and Winchester's elite will bury anyone connected to it. Sal Marino showed up at the card shop and told Nate the truth. Sal also carries a gun. Nate's angry, not at the people in the ledger, but at Cecil for forty-one years of silence. Every Sunday dinner, every birthday, and the old man sat there knowing everything and said nothing. Last seen at Terry's card shop after closing, reaching under the counter for a bat that wasn't there.
