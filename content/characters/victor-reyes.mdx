# Victor Reyes

Victor Reyes was once the most feared enforcer in the Syndicate's security division. After a mission went wrong and innocent lives were lost, he abandoned his corporate allegiance and now fights to protect those the system has failed.

## Transformation

The incident that changed Victor forever occurred during a routine suppression operation in the Shadow District. When he discovered that his targets were simply families trying to survive, he turned his weapons on his own squad and vanished into the night.

## Combat Style

Victor combines military training with street-fighting techniques he learned in the Shadow District:

- **Tactical Analysis**: Instant battlefield assessment and strategic planning
- **Enhanced Reflexes**: Years of combat augmentation
- **Weapons Mastery**: Proficient with both traditional and energy-based weapons

## The Obsidian Blade

Victor wields the legendary Obsidian Blade, an ancient weapon he discovered in the ruins beneath Fanhattan. The blade is said to cut through both matter and energy, making it one of the most dangerous artifacts in the city.
