# Mayor Franklin Tate

Two-term Mayor of Fanhattan, Press Vandermeer's handpicked candidate, and the man whose voice Margaret Ogilvie heard inside Morrow's Manor at three in the morning. Named fourteen times in Cecil Fontaine's ledger. His presence in the Manor is unexplained, his connection to the Syndicate is documented, and his political survival depends on whether the walls closing in reach him before the next election cycle. Whatever he was doing inside that house, in the dark, in the middle of the night, is a question that currently has no answer and a dozen very interested parties.
