# Baby Brownbag

Every family has a weird genius, and for the Brownbags, that's Baby. Probability expert, tech specialist, and the Resistance's brain trust, Baby operates at the intersection of cutting-edge theory and methods that make Bailey wince. Brilliant doesn't cover it. Unconventional barely scratches the surface. Where Bailey builds elegant trackers and calibrated sensors, Baby builds things that look like a garage sale had a fight with a physics lab and both lost. The results, though? The results speak for themselves. Baby's work forms the technological backbone of everything the Resistance does, from intercepting Syndicate communications to mapping probability fields that shouldn't exist. The bag stays on, naturally. Brownbags don't do things halfway.
