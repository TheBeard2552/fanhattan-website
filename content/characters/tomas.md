# Tomas

Twenty-six years old, stockroom worker at Casa de Boom, and the quietest person in the loudest district in Fanhattan. Tomas keeps the back room organized, the inventory counted, and his head down with the kind of focused silence that Papi attributes to work ethic and everyone else attributes to shyness. He's been at the shop long enough to know the routines, the rhythms, and where every piñata sits on every shelf. He knows when deliveries come in and when they go out. He knows the schedules. He knows the blind spots. In La Fiesta, where celebration is currency and noise is power, Tomas is the still point at the center of the chaos, the guy who's always in the room but never in the conversation. Whether that makes him reliable or something else entirely is a question that Papi hasn't thought to ask yet. Someone should.
