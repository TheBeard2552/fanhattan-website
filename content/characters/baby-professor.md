## What They Want

To understand probability manipulation at a fundamental level and develop tools the Resistance can use against the Syndicate. Baby (or "Professor") is the tech specialist and probability expert of the Resistance brain trust.

## What Stands In Their Way

The Syndicate's head start in probability research. The inherent unpredictability of belief-based reality. Conventional thinking that dismisses unconventional methods.

## What They're Willing to Risk

Reputation. Safety. The comfort of working within established frameworks. Baby operates outside the box.

## Reputation (Street Truth)

"Baby? Professor? Brilliant. Unconventional methods. Part of the Resistance brain trust. Don't ask how they know what they know—just be glad they're on our side."

## Private Truth

Baby sees probability in ways most people can't. That gift comes with a cost—the world looks different when you can sense the currents of belief and possibility. Sometimes it's isolating. Sometimes it's the only thing that makes sense.
