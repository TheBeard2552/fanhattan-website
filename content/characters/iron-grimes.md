# Harlan "Iron" Grimes

Coach Grimes is dead. Cancer took him in the parking lot after his final graduation ceremony, right after he watched four prospects climb clean to Top Tier with a hundred percent success rate. That was the public ending. The private one was the manila folder in his freezer: twenty years of documented Syndicate corruption, every bribe, every rigged ranking, every name and date and dollar amount. He gave it to Billy. The Resistance published everything. Commissioner Park resigned. The Proving Grounds nearly collapsed and then rebuilt itself, cleaner than it had been in two decades. His plaque at Grindhouse Gym reads: "The work is the point. Not the ranking. Not the graduation. The work itself. Do it honest and you'll be able to live with what you see in the mirror." Iron earned that name. The Proving Grounds is still paying the interest.
