# Keisha Washington

Keisha Washington is the conscience of the Proving Grounds, the woman who gave Coach Grimes his eulogy and then turned around and co-chaired the rebuilt Draft Board with Brown Bag Billy. When the Syndicate's corruption blew the district apart, when prospects were jumping ship and the rankings board was nothing but a monument to rigged games, Keisha stayed. She fought for clean evaluations, transparent metrics, and the radical idea that merit should actually mean something. The old guard thinks she's naive. The new prospects think she's a hardass. Both are right, and Keisha wouldn't have it any other way. In a city that keeps score, she's trying to make sure the scoreboard is honest for the first time in twenty years.
