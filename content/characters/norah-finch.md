# Norah Finch

She's twelve. She plays soccer. She wanted to go home, finish her homework, and play Minecraft. None of that happened. Norah Finch walked into Winchester's Open House wearing a Bengals hoodie and carrying a civics extra-credit assignment, and every probability sensor within four blocks went haywire because Norah can see golden threads hanging in the air like cobwebs in sunlight. She's been seeing them her whole life. She assumed everyone could. She stopped telling people about it at age eight, after her teacher suggested a "behavioral assessment." Now she draws the threads in her notebooks with gold gel pen and keeps her mouth shut. Her reading was 412% above probability baseline, higher than Papi, higher than anything the Resistance has ever measured. The Syndicate texted one word: "Found." Billy is moving to protect her. And the golden threads pouring out of Morrow's Manor? Norah can see every single one. The last journal wrote itself: "She can hear me." Norah Finch didn't sign up for any of this. The city signed her up anyway.
