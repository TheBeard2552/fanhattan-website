# Fade God

His real name is Marcus Fitzgerald, but everyone calls him Fade God because his sports picks are so legendarily, spectacularly, almost supernaturally bad that fading them, betting the opposite, hits at an eighty-two percent rate. He doesn't know this. Or rather, he knows it and has constructed an elaborate framework of excuses involving "anomalies in the probability matrix" and, occasionally, lunar cycles. Fade God operates out of Sal's Deli with an array of monitors, tablets, and at least one device that violates several FCC regulations, measuring "probability flux" with the confidence of a man who has never once questioned his methodology. He switches to a British academic accent when defensive. He factors in jersey color psychology. His celestial alignment model predicted zero correct outcomes last quarter. In a city where probability manipulation is real, Fade God is the walking proof that believing you understand the system and actually understanding the system are two very different things. He's also, despite everything, one of Billy's most loyal friends. And his inverse accuracy might be more useful than anyone realizes.
