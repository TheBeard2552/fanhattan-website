# Vito & Tony DeLucca (The Twins)

They work for Sal, they keep their heads down, and they make problems disappear with the quiet efficiency of men who learned the trade from uncles who learned it from their uncles. Vito handles the books, the deliveries, and the odds. Tony handles the rest. Between them, they cover every angle of Sal Marino's independent operation in Stadium South, a matching set of enforcers who move through the district like they were born on its sidewalks, because they were. Vito's got one foot in the old mob world and hates it; his risk tolerance is near zero unless someone threatens his mother, at which point the entire calculation changes. Tony keeps the pawn shop, the one honest fence operation in the district, and proves daily that you can move merchandise without selling your soul. They're brothers. They're loyal. And they're watching the same streets their grandfather watched, waiting for the moment when the old ways become relevant again.
