## What They Want

To stay under the radar while making enough money to keep his mom in the nice nursing home uptown. Everything Vito does traces back to that singular goal: keep Mom comfortable, don't make waves, survive long enough to retire.

## What Stands In Their Way

The Syndicate, who keep trying to "recruit" him for their operations. The Resistance, who keep trying to get information from him. The fact that working for Sal means he's more visible than he'd like. People notice the guy who always delivers on time, always gets the odds right, always knows a guy who knows a guy.

## What They're Willing to Risk

Not much. Vito's risk tolerance is near zero. He'll bend rules, but he won't break them. He'll facilitate connections, but he won't take sides unless Sal tells him to. The moment something feels too hot, he's out.

Exception: If someone threatens his mom or Sal, Vito will burn the whole city down. But nobody's that stupid. Yet.

## Reputation (Street Truth)

"Vito? Quiet guy. Works for Sal. Keeps his head down. Runs numbers, makes deliveries, doesn't cause problems. If you need something moved and you want it done right, Vito's your guy. Just don't ask him to do anything crazy."

## Private Truth

He's got one foot in the old mob world through Sal and family connections, and he both loves and hates it. His uncles keep trying to pull him into their "let's reclaim Fanhattan" schemes, and Vito wants no part of it.

But he can't completely cut ties because Sal is the one who got him into this business, and Sal's like a second father. So he walks the tightrope: helpful enough to stay in everyone's good graces, not committed enough to go down when they inevitably crash.

He's also skimming. Just a little. From side jobs, not from Sal. Nothing big enough to notice, but over time? It adds up. Vito's retirement fund is built on being the most trustworthy unreliable person in Stadium South.
