# The Professor

If Baby is the Resistance's mad scientist, The Professor is the one who writes the textbook after Baby blows up the lab. Fanhattan's foremost probability theorist and the person most responsible for understanding how belief energy actually works at a mechanical level, The Professor exists in the strange space between academic and operative. The research is impeccable. The conclusions are terrifying. When Cornelius Morrow's journals surfaced with claims that the city itself is conscious, The Professor was the first person Billy called, because if anyone could tell the difference between a dead man's ravings and a paradigm-shifting revelation, it's the person who's spent their entire career studying exactly what Morrow described. The Professor hasn't weighed in yet. That silence is making everyone nervous.
