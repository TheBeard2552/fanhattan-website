# Dante Martinez

Tidewater exile, Proving Grounds graduate, and the living proof that Coach Grimes's system works if you let it. Dante was one of Iron's final four prospects, the ones who climbed clean to Top Tier without bribes, without Syndicate shortcuts, without the corruption that had been rotting the Draft Board for twenty years. Now he's assistant coach at Grindhouse Gym, running morning drills for six new bottom-tier prospects and carrying Grimes's philosophy forward: the work is the point. Dante doesn't talk about why he left Tidewater. Tidewater doesn't talk about why he left either, which tells you everything. In a district built on the idea that nothing is guaranteed and everything must be earned, Dante is the rare graduate who actually believes it.
