# Dolores "Dee" Morrow

The last living Morrow, and the only person in Fanhattan who's been keeping score on the Manor for longer than the Resistance has. Dee lives in a studio apartment in Stadium South, works part-time at the library, and has been cataloging probability events around her family's abandoned estate for fifteen years: 847 entries, each one a small piece of a puzzle she can't quite assemble. Winchester's society women pretend she doesn't exist. The Winchester power structure pretends the Manor doesn't exist. Dee recently felt "the tingle" for the first time, that pulsing behind the molars that Papi describes, and it scared her more than anything in the journals ever could. She filed an emergency injunction to stop the demolition. Whatever's inside that house, Dee believes her family name gives her the right to find out before someone else tears it down.
