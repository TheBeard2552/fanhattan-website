# Gus Papadopoulos

Third-generation Cabot's Landing dock worker, demolition foreman, and the most practical man in Fanhattan until Morrow's journals made practical irrelevant. Gus was hired to tear down the Manor. Simple job, good money, go home. Then his crew found the sealed room, and inside it, forty-seven journals that describe his grandmother's death in 1987 with perfect accuracy, including details nobody else knows, including the thing she whispered before she died. Two guys quit Monday. A third called in sick Tuesday and hasn't come back. Gus sent his crew home, sat on the porch, chain-smoked his way through a pack of Camels, and brought the journals to the only place he could think of: Shep's Bar. He'd walk away from the money if the Manor is genuinely dangerous. But walking away from money is the hardest thing Gus knows how to do, and the fact that he's considering it tells you exactly how scared he is.
