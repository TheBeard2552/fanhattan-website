# Yolanda

Forty-one, from the Bayou, and the woman who runs Casa de Boom's register with the kind of no-nonsense efficiency that keeps Papi's chaotic operation from collapsing into a confetti pile. Yolanda is under suspicion because everyone in Casa de Boom is under suspicion now that Tomas turned, but the smart money says she's clean. She came to La Fiesta because the Bayou's authenticity culture was starting to feel as performative as the thing it claimed to oppose, and Papi's shop was the first place in Fanhattan where the joy was real. Whether that loyalty survives the storm currently bearing down on Casa de Boom remains to be seen. Yolanda's the kind of person who'll ride or die for a cause she believes in. The question is whether she still believes in this one.
