# Lady Luck

She arrives in silk and leaves in mystery, and the space between those two moments is where Lady Luck does her best work. Elegant, theatrical, and possessed of a cutting wit that can fillet a man's ego in five words or fewer, Lady Luck operates in Fanhattan's probability underworld with the kind of poise that suggests she's been doing this longer than anyone suspects. She's Billy's confidante, his sounding board during two-in-the-morning crises, and the person most likely to tell him the brutal truth while examining her nails like it's the least interesting thing she's said all day. Where she came from, who she was before, and what her real name is are questions that don't get answered in Stadium South. What is known: her instincts about people are almost never wrong, her tolerance for nonsense is almost nonexistent, and when she says "Then do not lose," she means it like it's the simplest thing in the world.
