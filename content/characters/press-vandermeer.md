# Prescott "Press" Vandermeer III

Three-term Winchester alderman, old money bloodline, and the man who runs the Heights with a handshake and a veiled threat. Press Vandermeer's smile has been on every campaign poster in the district for fifteen years, and behind that smile is eleven years of laundering Syndicate money through the city council's "infrastructure improvement fund." He's named forty-seven times in Cecil Fontaine's ledger. His power is eroding story by story, scandal by scandal, and the man who once controlled Winchester like a personal chess board is running out of moves. His daughter Elena found his Syndicate records three years ago and copied them. The Quiet Room cracked his composure. And the sidewalks keep building paths to a Manor that holds secrets even Press is afraid of. He'll sacrifice anyone's career, reputation, and livelihood to survive. Anyone's but his own.
