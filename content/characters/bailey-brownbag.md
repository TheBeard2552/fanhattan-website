# Bailey Brownbag

Billy's sister, the Resistance's resident probability researcher, and the smartest person in most rooms she walks into. Bailey Brownbag wears a bag, because that's what Brownbags do, but hers adapts to context: in Winchester, it was a fitted paper bag shaped into a structured cloth hat, because Bailey believes in blending in while standing out. She designed the probability trackers, monitors La Fiesta's baseline readings, and confirmed that Winchester's unauthorized sidewalks are genuine probability manifestations, the densest natural field she'd ever measured until Norah Finch walked through the Open House. Bailey is Billy's right hand, his strategic brain, and the person most likely to explain why everything you think you know about probability in Fanhattan is slightly wrong. She's been tracking patterns for years. The patterns are starting to track back.
