## What They Want

To support the Resistance through probability research and strategic planning. Bailey is Billy's cousin and operates as his right hand—providing the intelligence and analysis that makes Billy's field operations possible.

## What Stands In Their Way

The Syndicate's superior resources. The complexity of probability manipulation. The risk of being targeted as a key Resistance asset.

## What They're Willing to Risk

Safety. Reputation. The comfortable life that could have been. Bailey chose the Resistance over neutrality.

## Reputation (Street Truth)

"Bailey? Smart. Competent. Billy's right hand. Don't know much else—keeps to the research side. But when Billy needs intel, Bailey's the one who provides it."

## Private Truth

Bailey carries the weight of being the "sensible" Brownbag—the one who has to think through consequences while Billy charges ahead. Sometimes that means watching family take risks that keep Bailey up at night.
