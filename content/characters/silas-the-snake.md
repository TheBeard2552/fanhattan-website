# Silas the Snake

Half serpent, half man, and all nightmare. Silas the Snake is one of the Syndicate's most feared operatives, his upper body that of a massive cobra, scaled and hooded, with slit-pupil eyes that track movement the way a predator tracks prey, while his lower half remains disturbingly human, legs carrying him through Fanhattan's streets like something that crawled out of a probability experiment gone wrong. In a city where snake tattoos mark Syndicate probability manipulators, Silas doesn't need the ink. He *is* the mark. He operates in the shadow space between the Syndicate's public operations and its darkest machinery, the kind of operative who shows up when negotiations have failed and examples need to be made. What makes Silas particularly dangerous isn't the serpentine head or the fangs or the hood that flares when he's about to strike. It's the patience. Most Syndicate enforcers are blunt instruments. Silas is a scalpel, the kind of threat that watches for weeks, identifies the precise pressure point, and applies exactly enough force to collapse everything around it. Billy's beaten the Syndicate before. Silas is the Syndicate's answer to the question of what happens when they stop sending the B-team.
