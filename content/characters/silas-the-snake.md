# Silas the Snake

In a city where snake tattoos mark Syndicate probability manipulators, the name "Silas the Snake" carries the kind of weight that clears rooms. Silas operates in the shadow space between the Syndicate's public operations and its darkest machinery, the kind of operative who shows up when negotiations have failed and examples need to be made. The tattoo isn't just a brand; it's a statement of capability, a warning that the person wearing it can bend probability in ways that make coincidences lethal. What makes Silas particularly dangerous isn't the power. It's the patience. Most Syndicate enforcers are blunt instruments. Silas is a scalpel, the kind of threat that watches for weeks, identifies the precise pressure point, and applies exactly enough force to collapse everything around it. Billy's beaten the Syndicate before. Silas is the Syndicate's answer to the question of what happens when they stop sending the B-team.
