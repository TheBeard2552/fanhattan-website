# Margaret Ogilvie

Margaret Ogilvie has been Winchester's Senior City Planner for twenty-eight years, and if you've ever wondered why the district has no sidewalks, she's your answer. Section 14.7(b) of the zoning code is her masterpiece, her middle finger to every developer who ever tried to make Winchester look like everywhere else. She's proud of it, too, not because it keeps the riffraff out, but because it was the one time she beat the money. Then the sidewalks started appearing anyway, pouring themselves overnight in clean, smooth concrete that led straight to Morrow's Manor, and Margaret's life's work became a joke told in wet cement. She followed the last sidewalk to the Manor at 3 AM. She heard the Mayor's voice inside. She walked out and told Gus to tear it down. What she saw in there? She hasn't told a soul.
