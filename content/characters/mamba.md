# Mamba

If Silas is the scalpel, Mamba is the venom. Fast, ruthless, and possessing the kind of street-level probability manipulation that makes fights end before anyone realizes they've started, Mamba operates at the intersection of Syndicate enforcement and pure survival instinct. The name isn't an accident; like the snake, Mamba strikes first and doesn't need to strike twice. In the Syndicate's hierarchy, Mamba occupies the space reserved for people who are too dangerous to promote and too useful to discard, the enforcer's enforcer, the one they send when the situation has gone sideways and cleanup needs to happen fast. Loyalty to the Syndicate runs deep, but in Fanhattan, loyalty is a probability equation like everything else. The right pressure, the right moment, and even the most reliable operatives start recalculating their odds.
