# Mamba

If Silas is the scalpel, Mamba is the venom. Sleek, serpentine, and built to kill, Mamba's upper body is pure snake, dark-scaled and narrow-headed with the flat, unblinking eyes of a black mamba, while human legs carry that nightmare forward at speeds that end fights before anyone realizes they've started. Where Silas is patient and deliberate, Mamba is velocity and violence, a Syndicate enforcer whose reptilian torso coils and strikes with the kind of street-level probability manipulation that turns dark alleys into death sentences. The name isn't an accident; like the snake, Mamba strikes first and doesn't need to strike twice. In the Syndicate's hierarchy, Mamba occupies the space reserved for people who are too dangerous to promote and too useful to discard, the enforcer's enforcer, the one they send when the situation has gone sideways and cleanup needs to happen fast. Loyalty to the Syndicate runs deep, but in Fanhattan, loyalty is a probability equation like everything else. The right pressure, the right moment, and even the most reliable operatives start recalculating their odds.
