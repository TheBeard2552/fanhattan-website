# Shep

Shep runs the most popular bar in Stadium South. His establishment is neutral ground where rivals can drink together, and deals are made across faction lines.

## Philosophy

Shep publicly espouses meritocracy—he believes the best should win. But privately, he's a pragmatist who understands that survival sometimes requires compromising principles.

## The Bar

Shep's bar is covered in memorabilia and stat boards. It's where records are made official, bets are settled, and reputations are built or destroyed.

## Secret Life

What most patrons don't know is that Shep keeps meticulous records of every conversation, every deal, and every scandal that unfolds in his bar. This information is his real currency.
