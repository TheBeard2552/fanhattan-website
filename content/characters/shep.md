# Shep

Don't call him Shepherd. Only three people in this city are allowed to do that, Papi, Sal, and Billy, and even they use it sparingly. To everyone else he's just Shep, the barrel-chested bar owner who knows everything that happens in Stadium South and most of what happens everywhere else. His bar is the neutral ground, the safe house, the information exchange, and the beating heart of the district, all crammed into a building that smells like stale beer and diesel. You want to know who's moving what? Buy Shep a beer and bring patience. He won't tell you directly; he'll just mention that so-and-so was in Tuesday, and such-and-such delivery came through Wednesday, and you can do the math yourself. He's tired. Twenty years of holding this place together with duct tape and stubbornness will do that. But he can't quit, because the moment Shep's Bar goes dark, Stadium South loses its heart. And the journals that just landed on his counter say the city itself might have plans for him.
