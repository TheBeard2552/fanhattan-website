# Betty Boom

Betty Boom runs Crystal Clear Futures, a fortune-telling shop on the edge of Meadow Hills where she frosts cupcakes, gives encouraging tarot readings, and quietly protects the most aggressively normal district in Fanhattan from forces its residents don't even know exist. She rides a mobility scooter that can hit thirty-five miles per hour and carries hidden compartments loaded with surveillance equipment, signal jammers, and communication gear that would make a spy novelist jealous. Her "gift" manifests as flash visions of possible futures, preview trailers of coming threats with a particular emphasis on her community, and those visions have been getting stronger. Now she needs to figure out why "boring" old Meadow Hills is potentially under attack, and who cares enough to upend her quiet little community.
