# Brown Bag Billy

Nobody knows what Billy Brownbag (also known as "Brown Bag Billy" after his ascension) actually looks like. The brown paper bag stays on, always, because that's what Brownbags do, and Billy is nothing if not loyal to the family tradition. What people do know is that he's the most dangerous probability manipulator in Fanhattan, a living legend who merged with a probability branch and walked away with abilities that make the Syndicate lose sleep. He fights for the Resistance, protects the people who can't protect themselves, and does impossible shit on a regular enough basis that half the city thinks he's cheating. The other half thinks he's lucky. Billy knows the truth is worse than either: every time he uses his abilities, he can feel pieces of himself scattering across probability branches like cards thrown into the wind. The guy with the bag who does impossible stuff. That's the legend. What's underneath? Even Billy's not sure anymore.
