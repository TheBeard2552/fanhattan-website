# Brown Bag Billy

Billy is a fixture in The Proving Grounds, known for his uncanny ability to procure anything and find anyone. He operates from a makeshift stall where he trades in information, supplies, and survival advice.

## Background

Though he presents as a lifelong Proving Grounds resident, Billy actually came from Stadium South's elite circles. After a betting scandal ruined his career, he fled and built a new identity in the one place no one would look for a former champion.

## Role in the Community

Billy serves as an unofficial guide for newcomers to The Proving Grounds. He teaches survival skills, brokers deals, and maintains a network of contacts across Fanhattan.

## Connections

Despite his low-key operation, Billy has ties to the Resistance and occasionally passes intelligence about Syndicate movements.
