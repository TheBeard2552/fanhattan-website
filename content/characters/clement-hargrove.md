# Judge Clement Hargrove

For eighty-one years, Judge Clement Hargrove has been a pillar of Winchester respectability, the kind of man whose handshake was supposedly worth more than a notarized contract. Poker regular at the Birchingham Club, three-time refuser of Syndicate bribes, and the walking embodiment of incorruptible justice. Beautiful story. Mostly true. But the Quiet Room doesn't care about "mostly," and after seven hours in that truth-compulsion parlor, the Judge confessed to something he'd buried for twenty-two years...and now the pillar has a large crack running straight through it.
