# Honesty in Business

The belief that integrity and success aren't mutually exclusive. In a city where most businesses cut corners and deal dirty, this belief maintains that honest dealing is both possible and necessary.

## Core Tenets

- **Principles Over Profit**: Keep your standards even when it costs you
- **Reputation Matters**: Trust built over years beats quick money
- **The Game Deserves Respect**: Honor what you do by doing it right

## Cultural Significance

This belief often emerges in characters who've seen what corruption does to communities and choose a different path, even when it's harder.
