# Meritocracy Is Honest

The belief that the world works best when outcomes are determined purely by skill, effort, and performance. Those who hold this belief see meritocracy as the most honest form of social organization.

This belief often clashes with those who see systemic advantages and disadvantages. It's an optimistic view that assumes equal opportunity exists or can be created.

## Core Tenets
