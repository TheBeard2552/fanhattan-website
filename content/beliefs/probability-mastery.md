# Probability Mastery

In Fanhattan, where belief shapes reality, those who can sense and manipulate probability currents wield immense power. This belief holds that mastering probability isn't just useful—it's the fundamental skill that separates winners from losers.

## Core Tenets

- **Reality Is Malleable**: Probability isn't fixed; it responds to belief
- **Knowledge Is Power**: Understanding the currents gives you control
- **Unconventional Methods Work**: Traditional thinking can't grasp probability manipulation

## Practitioners

Characters who hold this belief often work in technical fields, study patterns obsessively, or have innate gifts for sensing probability shifts.
