# Old Ways Matter

A belief that the past held standards and honor that the present has lost. Those who hold this belief see themselves as preserving something valuable that's being forgotten.

## Core Tenets

- **Honor Over Efficiency**: The old codes had meaning
- **Tradition Provides Structure**: Rules exist for a reason
- **Respect Is Earned Through History**: The young haven't proven themselves

## Manifestation

Often held by older characters who remember "how things used to be" and resent the new order that replaced traditional power structures.
