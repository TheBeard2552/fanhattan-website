# Survival Over Glory

The foundational belief that pragmatism trumps idealism. Those who hold this belief prioritize survival, flexibility, and adaptation over rigid principles or dying for a cause.

This belief often emerges in environments where resources are scarce and mistakes are fatal. It's a defensive worldview that values cunning over courage.

## Core Tenets

- **Live to Fight Another Day**: Retreat is not cowardice; it's strategy
- **Honor Doesn't Feed You**: Material security beats reputation
- **The Dead Have No Comebacks**: Preservation of self enables future action

## Cultural Manifestations

Districts like The Proving Grounds embrace this belief, where every day is a test of adaptation and resourcefulness. Characters who hold this belief are often seen as calculating, but they're the ones who endure.
