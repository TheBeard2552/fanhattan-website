# Family Above All

The belief that family obligations supersede all other considerations. Those who hold this belief measure their choices by one standard: does it protect and provide for their family?

## Core Tenets

- **Blood Matters Most**: Family comes before ideology, business, or self
- **Duty Over Desire**: What you want doesn't matter; what they need does
- **Justified by Love**: Any action is acceptable if it serves family

## Motivation

This belief drives characters to make hard choices, bend rules, and sometimes compromise their other principles—all in service of those they love.
