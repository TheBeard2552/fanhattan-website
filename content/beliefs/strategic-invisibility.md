# Strategic Invisibility

The art of being present but not prominent. This belief holds that survival comes from being valuable enough to keep around but not interesting enough to threaten.

## Core Tenets

- **Don't Make Waves**: Visibility attracts danger
- **Be Useful, Not Essential**: Essential people become targets
- **Loyalty Is Selective**: You can't take sides if no one knows where you stand

## Psychology

Characters holding this belief are often survivors who've learned that the safest position is in the middle—helpful to all, committed to none.
