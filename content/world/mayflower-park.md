## Core Belief

Mayflower Park is beautiful during the day and dangerous at night. It's where old Italian guys play bocce and talk about when they ran the town. The waterfront stinks of old crime and broken redevelopment dreams. And now—potential mob resurgence happening here.

## What It Controls

The moral geography of the waterfront. A gathering place for the old families. A place where deals get made away from Syndicate ears. Where the Resistance finds sympathetic ears in the Italian-American community.

## What It Fears

Being forgotten. Being developed. The Syndicate moving in before the old guard can reclaim what was theirs.

## Unspoken Truth

The old-timers playing bocce in Mayflower Park know which families are feuding and which are making peace. You want to know what's really happening in Fanhattan? Buy a beer in Stadium South and shut up for an hour. Or walk through Mayflower Park at dusk and listen.
