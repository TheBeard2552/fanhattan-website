## Core Belief

The Spire was built for the 1972 World's Fair. It was supposed to symbolize unity—a beacon that would bring Fanhattan together. Instead, it became the unofficial dividing line between districts. You can pay $20 to go to the observation deck. Nobody remembers what it was supposed to mean anymore.

## What It Controls

The skyline. The psychological center of the city. The line that districts use when they say "north of the Spire" or "south of the Spire." It doesn't control territory—it defines it.

## What It Represents

A failed promise. City leadership hoped it would replace the Trials, become a symbol of unity that would make competition unnecessary. It failed spectacularly. The Spire became a dividing line instead of a unifying symbol. The Trials, meanwhile, had already become fundamental to Fanhattan's identity.

## Unspoken Truth

The Spire might be more than a building. In a city where belief shapes reality, a structure built to symbolize unity—and then universally understood as division—could have accumulated its own probability weight. Nobody's studied it. Nobody wants to.
