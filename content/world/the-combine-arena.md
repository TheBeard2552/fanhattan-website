## Core Belief

The Combine Arena holds 15,000 seats, all metal bleachers. Hosts showcase games, tryouts, relegation battles. The acoustics are terrible but the crowds are loud. It's utilitarian—basic concessions, no frills. But the energy is intense because every game matters. Every performance is an audition. The arena doesn't flatter weak performance.

## What It Controls

The gateway to legitimacy. If you want to be taken seriously in Fanhattan, you must pass through here. Neutral probability field—minimal home advantage. The fairest competitions. The most violent crowds.

## Unspoken Truth

The Syndicate runs the relegation battles. Not always, but often enough. They decide who stays and who goes based on who's most useful. The arena is honest. The system around it isn't.
