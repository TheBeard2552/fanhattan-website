## Core Belief

Stadium South Yards holds 12,000—makeshift, improvised seating. True neutral venue. No district gets home advantage. This is where inter-district grudge matches happen. Minimal facilities. Maximum intensity. The fairest competitions in Fanhattan. The most violent crowds. If you want a clean fight, you come here. If you want to prove something in front of everyone who matters, you come here.

## What It Controls

The neutral ground for Trial competition. Where districts settle scores without home-court probability distortion. Where the city watches and judges.

## Unspoken Truth

Stadium South's neutrality is a lie. But the Yards? The Yards are real. Nobody fakes neutral when the stakes are this high. The crowds are violent because they care. Because here, finally, the playing field is level.
