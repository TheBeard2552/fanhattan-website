## Core Belief

Fanhattan is a dense, mythic sports-obsessed metropolis where belief, momentum, probability, and fandom translate into real power. The city remembers everything—every streak, every betrayal, every legend, every failure. It's a place where wearing the wrong colors in the wrong neighborhood can get your ass kicked, where buildings seem to ooze decades of diesel grime and cheap beer no matter how hard the rain tries to wash them clean, where the Spire stands downtown like a failed promise of unity that became the city's dividing line instead.

**GOLDEN RULE:** Fanhattan lore is about belief colliding with reality. Districts believe different things. Characters pay the price. The city keeps score.

## How Power Works

**Probability Manipulation** – When enough belief concentrates in one place, around one person, toward one outcome, reality starts adjusting. It's not magic. It's the accumulated weight of millions of fans' hopes and fears pressing down on the fabric of possibility until it gives. The Syndicate built an empire by learning to harvest this. The Brownbags learned to channel it through cards and talismans.

**Territorial Belief Systems** – Each district doesn't just have a culture. It has a truth. These aren't just vibes. They're localized reality distortions that stack bonuses and penalties on anyone operating within district boundaries.

**The Syndicate's Apparatus** – Before Billy started tearing holes in their operation, the Syndicate had perfected a system: harvest belief energy, manipulate outcomes, use manipulated outcomes to generate more belief, repeat. They turned Fanhattan into their own perpetual motion machine.

## What Never Changes

- The city's geography – Districts stay where they are. The Spire divides.
- Belief creates power – This is fundamental. You can't unmake this truth without unmaking Fanhattan itself.
- The Syndicate's foundation – Even weakened, they're not going away. They built too deep.
- Someone always pays the price – Probability doesn't come from nowhere. Every miracle has a cost.

## What Is Always In Flux

- District power dynamics – Alliances shift. Territories blur at the edges.
- Individual reputations – You're only as good as your last play.
- The Syndicate's strength – Right now they're wounded. But they're rebuilding. They always do.
- Probability currents – Like weather patterns, they shift. Hot streaks end. Cold streaks break.

## The Unspoken Truth

Fanhattan doesn't just reward winners. It creates them. And it doesn't just punish losers—it devours them. The city needs both. It feeds on the contrast, the drama, the eternal cycle of rise and fall. That's why it never really lets anyone leave.

The smart ones learn to ride the currents instead of fighting them. The smarter ones learn to manipulate those currents. And the smartest ones? They realize the city itself might be sentient—or at least aware—and they start wondering what happens when it finally gets hungry enough to stop playing by even its own flexible rules.
