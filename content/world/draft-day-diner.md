## Core Belief

Draft Day Diner is the only good restaurant in The Proving Grounds. Cheap, fast, massive portions. Where prospects celebrate making The Draft Board. Where relegated teams drown their sorrows. Open 24/7 because there's always someone celebrating or mourning. The emotional center of a district built on validation.

## What It Controls

Nothing official. Everything emotional. You can read the district's mood by who's in the Diner and how they're acting. Celebrations are loud. Mourning is quiet. Both happen every day.

## Unspoken Truth

The Diner has seen more broken dreams than anywhere in Fanhattan. It's also seen more second chances. Some of the best prospects in district history celebrated here before they made it. Some of the worst relegations drowned here before they gave up. The Diner doesn't judge. It just serves.
