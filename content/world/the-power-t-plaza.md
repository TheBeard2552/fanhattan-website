## Core Belief

The Power T Plaza is ground zero for all Vol Valley activities. A T-shaped plaza with a smaller T-shaped lake inside it. Used for tailgating every Saturday—football season or not. The lake's stocked with fish that are definitely older than fish should be. Nobody questions it. The checkerboard crosswalks get repainted weekly. Nobody knows who does it. Asking is disrespectful.

## What It Controls

The geographic and spiritual center of Vol Valley. The probability matrix that keeps 1998 alive. If the crosswalks ever stop appearing, the district collapses.

## Unspoken Truth

The crosswalk painting started with Dutch. He died. The crosswalks kept appearing. Some say it's his ghost. Some say it's collective probability manifestation. Jenny Nash might be painting them. The district needs to believe it's a miracle. The truth would break them.
