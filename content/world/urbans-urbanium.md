## Core Belief

Urban's Urbanium is the bar with the statue. The spiritual center of The Swamp. When the Gators are winning, it's electric. When they're losing, the energy drains like someone pulled a plug. The district becomes vulnerable. Urban's never coming back—but the bar carries his name and his spirit.

## What It Controls

The cultural pulse of The Swamp. Where you go to perform dominance. Where you go to mourn when performance isn't enough. The gator chomp has become an unconscious tic for long-time residents—Urban's is where it started.

## Unspoken Truth

The silence strategy—going quiet when losing—is survival. But it's also admission of fragility. Urban's Urbanium holds the district's mood. When it's empty, everyone knows what that means.
