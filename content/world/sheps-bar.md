## Core Belief

Shep's Bar sits on the corner like a lighthouse—if lighthouses smelled like stale beer and had bullet holes in the brick from the '03 riots. It's the beating heart of Stadium South. Bearded, barrel-chested Shep behind the bar. Regulars who've been coming for decades. A back office where more deals get made than at City Hall.

## What It Controls

Information. Shep knows who's talking to who. You want to know what's really happening in Fanhattan? Buy a beer and shut the hell up for an hour. You'll learn more than any Syndicate intelligence report could tell you.

## Unspoken Truth

If Shep closes, Stadium South loses its heart. And if Stadium South loses its heart, it stops being neutral ground. A lot of people depend on that neutrality. Shep keeps pouring drinks and hoping Billy and the Resistance can pull off a miracle before the whole thing collapses.
