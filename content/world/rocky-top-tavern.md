## Core Belief

Rocky Top Tavern is the main bar in Vol Valley. "Rocky Top" plays minimum once per hour—usually more like five times per hour. It's ground zero for the '98 faithful. When Tidewater wins championships, bar attendance drops. Someone organizes a "Rocky Top Unity Rally," everyone sings until they're hoarse, and the district stabilizes again.

## What It Controls

The emotional regulation of Vol Valley. The music. The ritual. The proof that 1998 isn't over as long as people keep singing.

## Unspoken Truth

The young people are leaving. The population is aging. But as long as Rocky Top plays, the district holds. When it stops—nobody wants to think about that.
