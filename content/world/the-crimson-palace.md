## Core Belief

Officially just "the community center." Everyone calls it the Crimson Palace. It's where district decisions get made, where the cultural aristocracy gathers, where probability currents are strongest. The Crimson Palace Arena hosts Trial matches with heavy home advantage—concentrated belief from dynasty faithful. State-of-the-art everything.

## What It Controls

Tidewater's power structure. The Elephant Zoo displaced all other animals. Dynasty Drive has monuments for each championship. The Bryant vs. Saban debate creates actual probability distortions. The Palace is the heart of it all.

## Unspoken Truth

The dynasty is maintained through sacrifices nobody talks about. The Palace is beautiful. What it cost to build—and to maintain—isn't in the brochures.
