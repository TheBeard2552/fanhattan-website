## Core Belief

Tony's Legit Pawn is the one honest pawn shop in Stadium South. In a district where sports memorabilia shops may or may not be Syndicate fronts, Tony's is the exception. Fair prices. No questions about provenance. The kind of place that survives because everyone needs at least one place they can trust.

## What It Controls

A flow of goods that moves through Stadium South. Pawn shops see everything—what people need to sell, what they're desperate to buy. Tony doesn't share that information. That's why he's still in business.

## Unspoken Truth

Tony pays protection like everyone else. But he's never been asked to move Syndicate product. Whether that's respect or oversight, he doesn't know. He's not asking.
