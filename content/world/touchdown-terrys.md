## Core Belief

Touchdown Terry's Cards & Collectibles is the honest card shop in Stadium South. Exactly one. Terry actually gives you a fair shake on sports memorabilia. Authentication. Fair prices. No fakes. No Syndicate suppliers. In a district full of memorabilia shops that deal in stolen goods, Terry's is the exception.

## What It Controls

The flow of legitimate collectibles through Stadium South. Information about what collectors are hunting. A proof of concept that you don't have to be dirty to survive.

## Unspoken Truth

Terry's uncle ran a memorabilia shop that got burned down in the '90s during a Syndicate territory grab. Terry rebuilt with one rule: never compromise. Every authentic card he sells is a middle finger to the Syndicate. He knows the second they decide he's more trouble than he's worth, they'll make an example of him. He stays open anyway.
