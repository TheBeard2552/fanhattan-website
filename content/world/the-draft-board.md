## Core Belief

The Draft Board dominates The Proving Grounds—a four-story digital display visible from anywhere in the district. It updates in real-time with current standings, performance metrics, trend arrows. Watching your name climb feels incredible. Watching it drop makes you nauseous. Keisha Washington built the algorithms. She knows when the numbers don't add up.

## What It Controls

Who gets resources. Who gets relegated. The entire meritocratic structure of The Proving Grounds. Top tier (70th percentile+) graduates. Bottom tier faces relegation. The Board is the law.

## Unspoken Truth

The Draft Board is rigged. Not completely, but enough. The Syndicate has influence. Keisha keeps a secret ledger of "impossible" ranking changes. She's building a case. She's also tempted, every day, to take their bribes. The Board gives her power. Power is hard to give up.
