## Core Belief

The '98 Archive is a building dedicated entirely to preserving newspaper clippings, game footage, memorabilia from that season. Managed by volunteer archivists who treat it with museum-level seriousness. Every stat, every play, every detail. When the district collapses, someone needs to have preserved the truth.

## What It Controls

The official record of 1998. The canon. What counts as real and what doesn't. Stat Man Dennis works eighteen-hour days maintaining it because if he doesn't, who will?

## Unspoken Truth

Some say Jenny Nash paints the crosswalks. The Archive has no comment. The miracle isn't real—it never was. Dutch did it by hand, and now someone else does. But the Archive preserves the myth. That's its job.
