## Core Belief

Warship wreck in the harbor. Rumors of experimental weaponry—"The Fanhattan Project." A Navy destroyer guards it. The Syndicate may have smuggled tech from it. Nobody knows for sure. Nobody's talking.

## What It Controls

Nothing. It's a wreck. But what might have been taken from it—that could control a lot. Probability tech. Weaponized belief. The kind of thing that could change the balance of power in Fanhattan.

## Unspoken Truth

If the Syndicate got their hands on Fanhattan Project tech, they didn't just smuggle it—they're using it. The question is where, and how, and whether the Resistance will ever find out.
