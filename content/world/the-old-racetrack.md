## Core Belief

South waterfront. Shut down in the 40s—races were fixed. Never redeveloped. A shady developer wants to build a new stadium there. It's a divisive issue. Possible Syndicate connection. Stadium South fears it: gentrification disguised as progress, the kind of "Ballpark Village" that would erase the district's identity.

## What It Controls

Prime waterfront real estate. The future of the south riverfront. The question of whether Fanhattan's working districts get to keep their character or get priced out.

## Unspoken Truth

The developer has Syndicate money. Everyone knows it. Nobody can prove it. If the stadium gets built, Stadium South's days as neutral ground are numbered.
