## Core Belief

Marble building with the "whisper effect"—conversations redirect to specific spots. Designed by Phineas T. Birchingham, FinanceBank founder. Is it ghost stories or acoustic engineering? Yes. Both. The building does things that shouldn't be possible. Whether that's probability, architecture, or something else—nobody's saying.

## What It Controls

Information flow. In a building where whispers travel to specific corners, the right people can hear things they shouldn't. Or make sure they're not heard. Birchingham knew what he was building.

## Unspoken Truth

The Syndicate has tried to buy the building three times. Each time, the deal fell through in ways that don't make sense. The building, some say, has opinions.
