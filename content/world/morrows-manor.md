## Core Belief

Morrow's Manor is abandoned but legendary. Winchester's elite maintain a buffer zone around it. Not for aesthetics—because it's actually haunted by probability ghosts. The Manor does things. Reality gets weird near it. Nobody talks about it in polite company.

## What It Controls

A chunk of prime Winchester real estate that nobody will develop. A reminder that even the Heights have secrets. A potential source of probability phenomena that neither the Syndicate nor the Resistance fully understand.

## Unspoken Truth

Morrow's Manor is Tier 3 Street Truth—ghost stories, local legends. But the probability distortions are real. Winchester's elite aren't maintaining a buffer zone for property values. They're scared.
