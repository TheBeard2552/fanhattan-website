## Core Belief

Grindhouse Gym is the main training facility in The Proving Grounds. Open 24/7. You can tell a team's prospects by which shift they can afford to train in. Prime time (afternoon) = top tier teams. Late night = bottom tier, scraping by. No frills. No comfort. Just function.

## What It Controls

Access to training. The hierarchy is visible in who's there when. Top tier gets better everything. Bottom tier gets chain-link and concrete. The Grind never stops.

## Unspoken Truth

Coach Harlan Grimes has trained half the prospects who made it out. He's dying. Slowly. He's using the time he has left to document Syndicate influence. Grindhouse will outlast him. The question is what it becomes after.
