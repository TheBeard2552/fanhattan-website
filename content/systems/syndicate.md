## Core Belief

The Syndicate built an empire by learning to harvest belief energy. When enough belief concentrates in one place, reality starts adjusting. The Syndicate learned to weaponize this. They run the probability dark markets. They install Oracles—people with natural sensitivity to probability currents—to track fluctuations. They use fear, spectacle, and carefully engineered "miracles" to keep the belief flowing.

When you control belief, you control reality. When you control reality in a city built on sports fandom, you control everything.

## How Power Is Earned

**The Apparatus** – Identify probability hotspots. Install infrastructure to harvest belief energy. Use that energy to manipulate outcomes across the city. Use manipulated outcomes to generate more belief. Rinse and repeat. They turned Fanhattan into their own perpetual motion machine.

**Key Elements** – Snake-faced operatives (probability manipulation). Protection rackets (Stadium South, other districts). Political connections (Winchester). Probability dark markets. Oracles for tracking fluctuations.

## What They Control

Probability manipulation infrastructure. Protection rackets. Political influence. The Draft Board (partial rigging). Relegation battles (often fixed). Fear and spectacle as tools.

## What They Fear

**Billy and the Resistance** – Billy has torn holes in their operation. They're wounded, rebuilding. But they're not going away. They built too deep. They're woven into too many structures.

**Exposure** – If the extent of their corruption were proven, it could destabilize the systems they've infiltrated. But proving it is nearly impossible—probability chaos looks like probability chaos.

## Unspoken Truth

The Syndicate doesn't understand Vol Valley's concentrated faith—it resists manipulation. That frustrates them. Frustrated Syndicates do stupid things. They're adapting. They always do. Even wounded, they're the most dangerous force in Fanhattan.
