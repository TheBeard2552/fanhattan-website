## Core Belief

The Resistance exists to oppose Syndicate control and protect Fanhattan's independence. They fight belief manipulation with belief—using the same probability currents the Syndicate harvests, but to break their hold rather than strengthen it.

**Core Mission:** Oppose Syndicate, protect Fanhattan's independence. Current status: Gaining ground, but the Syndicate is adapting.

## How Power Is Earned

Through field operations, intelligence, and probability expertise. Billy tears holes in Syndicate infrastructure. Bailey provides research and strategy. Baby/Professor develops tech and probability tools. Shep runs information and safe houses. Sal provides muscle and old-world connections.

## What They Control

**Key Members** – Brown Bag Billy (field operative, probability manipulator), Bailey Brownbag (researcher, strategist), Baby/Professor (tech and probability expertise), Shep (information, safe house), Sal (muscle, connections), various district sympathizers.

**Assets** – Information networks through Stadium South. Old Italian mob connections (Cabot's Landing) sympathetic to their cause. Probability manipulation capabilities through Billy and the Brownbag legacy.

## What They Fear

**Syndicate Rebuilding** – They're wounded but not gone. Every victory creates new adaptations. The fight never ends.

**The Convergence** – Global threat Billy's dad is investigating. Barely understood. Could change everything.

**Oracle Network** – Seven remaining Oracles to locate and free. The Syndicate's eyes and ears.

## Unspoken Truth

The Resistance is winning battles but the war is far from over. They depend on people like Shep who can't quit, Sal who wants to matter again, and Billy who might be fragmenting across probability branches. The cost of fighting belief with belief is that someone always pays. So far, they've been willing to pay. The question is how long that lasts.
