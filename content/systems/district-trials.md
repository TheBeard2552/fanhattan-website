## Core Belief

District Trials are Fanhattan's primary competitive framework for measuring athletic ability, strategic thinking, probability manipulation resistance, and team cohesion. They serve as the city's de facto "sport"—a combination of physical competition, mental endurance, and belief-energy management that determines district representation, individual rankings, and professional prospects.

In a city where belief shapes reality and districts run on collective probability energy, the Trials serve three purposes: District Representation (winners bring prestige and resources), Individual Advancement (performance determines Draft Board rankings), and Probability Regulation (channeling volatile belief energy into controlled outlets).

## How Power Is Earned

**Four-Person Squads** – District Trials require exactly four competitors per squad. Fanhattan's probability experts discovered that four-person teams create optimal belief energy resonance. The four traditional roles: Anchor (defensive specialist, probability stabilizer), Edge (offensive specialist, probability amplifier), Nexus (strategic coordinator), and Wild (unpredictable element).

**The Three Stages** – Stage One: The Gauntlet (individual performance, clean competition). Stage Two: The Flux (team coordination with active probability effects). Stage Three: The Clash (direct head-to-head competition, probability warfare).

## What They Control

**The Draft Board** – Performance translates to rankings through a weighted algorithm: 40% individual performance, 35% squad success, 15% trajectory, 10% intangibles. Top tier (70th percentile+) earns graduation from The Proving Grounds. Bottom tier faces relegation.

**Key Venues** – The Combine Arena (Proving Grounds, neutral), The Crimson Palace Arena (Tidewater, heavy home advantage), The Power T Complex (Vol Valley, temporal weirdness), Stadium South Yards (true neutral, most violent crowds).

## What They Fear

**Syndicate Corruption** – The Syndicate doesn't rig outcomes directly (too obvious). They rig the rankings. Manipulating algorithms, bribing officials, creating "bad luck" streaks. Separating legitimate probability chaos from artificial manipulation is nearly impossible.

## Visual Identity

Trials culture has its own slang: "Running clean" (competing without Syndicate enhancement), "Riding the current" (capitalizing on momentum), "Anchoring" (stabilizing your squad), "Flux burn" (pushing probability too hard), "The Grind" (daily training), "Proving out" (graduating), "Getting relegated" (losing your spot).

## Unspoken Truth

Trials aren't just about winning. They're about proving you belong, earning respect from districts that rejected you, building something with your squad, facing your own limits. Sometimes losing clean is better than winning dirty.
