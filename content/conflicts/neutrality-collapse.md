# The Neutrality Collapse

A recurring pattern in Fanhattan where supposedly neutral spaces are pressured into taking sides. This conflict represents the impossibility of staying out of larger power struggles.

When districts, businesses, or individuals try to remain neutral, they often find that neutrality itself becomes a political statement. Eventually, all parties must choose.

## Why It Matters

The collapse of neutrality forces characters to reveal their true loyalties and beliefs. It's a crucible moment that separates pragmatists from idealists, and tests whether institutions can remain above the fray.
