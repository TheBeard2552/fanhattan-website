# The Syndicate

The Syndicate is not a single organization but a loose confederation of power brokers, crime bosses, and political operators. They maintain control through a combination of economic leverage, violence, and strategic alliances.

## Structure

The Syndicate operates through cells and lieutenants rather than a single hierarchy. This makes it resilient to disruption but also prone to internal power struggles.

## Goals

- Expand territorial control
- Maintain monopolies on key resources
- Eliminate or absorb competing power structures

## Methods

The Syndicate prefers economic pressure and political manipulation to outright violence, though they're not above it when necessary.
