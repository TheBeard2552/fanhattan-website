## Core Belief

Excellence deserves isolation. Distance from the rabble isn't elitism—it's self-preservation. Winchester's elite believe they've earned their position and the buffer zone that protects it.

## How Power Is Earned

Money and legacy. New money buys houses. Old money runs the district.

## What They Control

The Mayor and city council members. Morrow's Manor (abandoned but legendary). No sidewalks (by design). City planning through political influence.

## What They Fear

Syndicate corruption reaching critical mass. Losing control when the rabble figures out Winchester's complicity.

## Visual Identity

Wrought-iron fences. No sidewalks. Old money architecture. Feels like a museum exhibit.

## Rival Districts

**Tidewater** – Need each other, don't like each other. **The Proving Grounds** – Legacy vs. merit. **Everyone else** – Class separation.

## Unspoken Truth

Morrow's Manor is actually haunted by probability ghosts. Winchester's elite maintain a buffer zone around it.
