# The Proving Grounds

The Proving Grounds is where Fanhattan's outcasts, desperados, and seekers go to test their limits. It's a place of harsh realities and no second chances.

## Culture

Unlike Stadium South's competitive glory-seeking, The Proving Grounds values pure survival and adaptation. People don't come here for fame—they come to prove they can endure.

## Territory

The district is a mix of abandoned industrial zones, temporary camps, and makeshift settlements. Infrastructure is minimal, and residents are expected to be self-sufficient.

## Reputation

Those who survive and thrive in The Proving Grounds earn a certain respect across Fanhattan. It's known as a place that forges the toughest individuals.
