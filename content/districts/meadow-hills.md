## Core Belief

You can live in Fanhattan without being obsessed. Fandom should be fun, not consuming. Meadow Hills is "Casual Central"—the district for people who want to enjoy sports without it consuming their identity.

## How Power Is Earned

By being normal. Successfully navigating Fanhattan's insanity while maintaining healthy boundaries.

## What They Control

The "normal" workforce. Reasonable political positions. Moral high ground (nobody cares). Escape routes from other districts' intensity.

## What They Fear

Earthquake (built on drained swamp). Being dragged into the factions.

## Visual Identity

60s-70s ranch houses. Generic suburban. It's not ugly, not beautiful—just normal.

## Rival Districts

**Everyone** – Cultural rejection. Meadow Hills isn't at war with anyone, it just opts out. When it does find allies, they tend to be people who also reject obsessive belief culture.

## Unspoken Truth

Residents pretend they're above the chaos, but they're closet fanatics hiding shrines in their basements.
