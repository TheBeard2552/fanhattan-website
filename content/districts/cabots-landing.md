## Core Belief

Survive on the margins until your moment comes. Wait strategically for redevelopment. Cabot's Landing (The Blight, The Docks) believes in outlasting everyone else. Stubbornness rewarded.

## How Power Is Earned

By outlasting everyone else. Stubbornness rewarded.

## What They Control

Prime waterfront real estate (run-down but valuable). Historical landmark status. Industrial infrastructure. Old Italian-American community power structure.

## What They Fear

Redevelopment displacing current residents. Syndicate entrenchment preventing redevelopment.

## Visual Identity

Run-down industrial. Rusted metal. Water-damaged buildings. Grimy but honest.

## Rival Districts

**Developers** – Redevelopment tension. **The Syndicate** – Historical opposition.

## Unspoken Truth

The Italian-American community is historically correct about "Caboto's Landing." The old mob connections are sympathetic to the Resistance out of generational anger.
