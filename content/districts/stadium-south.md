# Stadium South

Stadium South is the "Shithole Switzerland" of Fanhattan, the place everyone passes through and nobody admits they need. It's eight blocks of brick, diesel, and cheap beer south of the stadium, where neutrality is less a principle and more a survival tactic.

## Culture

Stadium South does not worship glory. It worships tomorrow. People here keep their heads down, keep their doors open, and keep their mouths shut, because the city remembers streaks and the Syndicate remembers debt.

## Economy

Bars. Bookies. Pawn shops. Card stores. Side hustles that become careers if you survive long enough. Information is currency, and most of it gets traded over a beer at Shep's.

## Power Structure

Power belongs to the people who can keep something open in a district built to close. Shep anchors the neighborhood. Tony and Vito hear everything. The neutrality is a public story. The real rule is simpler: don't make the district a battleground.
