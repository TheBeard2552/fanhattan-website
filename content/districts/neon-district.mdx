# Neon District

The Neon District stands as a testament to humanity's technological achievements and its excesses. Towering skyscrapers lined with holographic advertisements pierce the eternal smog layer, while below, millions navigate the labyrinthine streets in search of connection, commerce, or escape.

## Geography

Located in the eastern sector of Fanhattan, the Neon District spans over 40 square kilometers of vertical architecture. The district is divided into three main levels:

### Upper Levels (floors 100+)
Corporate penthouses and exclusive clubs where the elite conduct their business far above the chaos below.

### Mid Levels (floors 20-99)
The commercial heart, filled with markets, tech shops, and residential units for the working class.

### Lower Levels (ground - floor 19)
The underbelly where hackers, traders, and those seeking anonymity thrive in the permanent twilight of neon shadows.

## Culture

The Neon District never sleeps. Its 24-hour economy is powered by:

- **Tech Markets**: Where any device, legal or otherwise, can be acquired
- **Neural Cafés**: Social hubs where patrons connect directly to shared virtual experiences
- **Underground Networks**: Hidden communities of hackers and data runners who operate outside corporate control

## Notable Locations

- **The Grid**: A massive server farm that houses 40% of Fanhattan's data
- **Pixel Paradise**: The district's most famous entertainment complex
- **The Dead Zone**: An abandoned sector where experimental technology was tested, now home to scavengers and outcasts
