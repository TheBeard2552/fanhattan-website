# La Fiesta

La Fiesta is the heart of Fanhattan's celebration culture. Piñata crafters, street vendors, and musicians fill Calle Rota with color and sound. The district runs on belief energy channeled through piñatas—every smash, every celebration, feeds the probability fields that make the district hum.

## Culture

Casa de Boom and shops like it anchor the piñata economy. Crafters who can feel probability fields build piñatas that channel belief; smashers pay in Scraps to take their swings. The best crafters are minor celebrities. The best smashers become legends.

## Economy

Piñatas. Candy. Tacos. Music. The district exports celebration and imports belief. El Techo, Marco's taquería, and the string-lit stalls along Calle Rota form a circuit of commerce and culture.

## Power Structure

Power flows to those who control the piñata trade—the crafters who build them, the venues that host sessions, and the brokers who move Scraps. The Syndicate watches. The Resistance has contacts. Everyone wants a piece of what La Fiesta channels.
