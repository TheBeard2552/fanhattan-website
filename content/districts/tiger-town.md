## Core Belief

Unity through strategic ambiguity. Not choosing is itself a choice—and a powerful one. Contested by Mizzou Tigers, LSU Tigers, and Auburn Tigers—the district survives by being useful to all three without committing to any.

## How Power Is Earned

By being useful to all three Tiger factions without committing to any.

## What They Control

Contested territory between three main Tiger districts. Cincinnati Bengals reverence (unifying force). Generic tiger merchandise market. Information flow between competing factions.

## What They Fear

Being forced to choose. The moment they pick a side, they lose strategic value.

## Visual Identity

Orange and black stripes everywhere. Generic tiger imagery. Nothing distinctly Mizzou, LSU, or Auburn.

## Rival Districts

All three Tiger factions pressure residents to pick sides. Neutrality is becoming unsustainable.

## Unspoken Truth

The three factions are pressuring residents to pick sides. Neutrality is becoming unsustainable.
