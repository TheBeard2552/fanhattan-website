## Core Belief

Authenticity over performance. Real swamp culture can't be faked. The Bayou believes they do it right—unlike The Swamp's performative dominance.

## How Power Is Earned

By being the most authentically, obnoxiously, unapologetically "bayou" person in the room.

## What They Control

"Shitty swamp" aesthetic. Corn dog smell generation (probability manifestation). Cultural credibility. Connection to actual Louisiana culture.

## What They Fear

The Swamp stealing their thunder with marketable swamp culture.

## Visual Identity

Overalls. "Eaux" spellings everywhere. Buildings that lean on purpose. Corn dog smell is constant.

## Rival Districts

**The Swamp** – Authentic vs. performative swamp culture war.

## Unspoken Truth

Half the residents have never been to Louisiana. They're performing bayou culture based on what they think it's like—but the performance has become reality.
