# Shadow District

Beneath the gleaming towers of Fanhattan lies the Shadow District, a network of tunnels, ruins, and improvised structures that predates the modern city. Here, those rejected by the system above have built a new society governed by different rules.

## History

The Shadow District occupies what remains of Old Fanhattan, the original city that was buried when the corporate syndicates expanded upward. Archaeological evidence suggests civilizations existed here for thousands of years before the modern era.

## Structure

Unlike the planned architecture above, the Shadow District is organic and chaotic:

### The Warrens
Interconnected tunnels that form the main transportation network, carved through ancient foundations and natural cave systems.

### The Hollows
Large chambers that serve as communal spaces, markets, and gathering points for the district's inhabitants.

### The Deep
Unexplored sections that descend into darkness. Few who venture into the Deep return, and those who do speak of ancient technologies and unknown dangers.

## Society

The Shadow District operates on a barter economy and mutual aid:

- **The Council of Echoes**: Elected representatives who mediate disputes
- **Free Clinics**: Medical care for all, no questions asked
- **The Archives**: A library preserving pre-corporate history that the syndicates tried to erase

## Dangers

While the Shadow District offers freedom from corporate control, it comes with risks:

- Structural instability from centuries of decay
- Territorial disputes between different factions
- Unknown entities lurking in the unexplored depths
- Corporate raids seeking to expand downward or eliminate perceived threats
