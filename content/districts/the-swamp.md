## Core Belief

Dominance is performance. You have to look like a winner, act like a winner, chomp like a winner. It's not enough to win—you have to perform victory. Be theatrical. Be audacious. Chase cars while chomping.

## How Power Is Earned

Through audacity. Talk loudest. Party hardest. Chase cars while chomping. Be theatrical, but back it up when it matters.

## What They Control

Buildings alternating between "modern Miami" and "shitty swamp." Urban's Urbanium (bar with the statue). Cultural dominance when Gators are winning. The gator chomp—becoming a compulsion for long-time residents.

## What They Fear

**Irrelevance** – Being ignored is worse than losing. The generational divide. The Bayou doing authentic swamp better.

## Visual Identity

Orange and blue. Jorts unironically. Mullets encouraged. Everything feels slightly damp. Electric when good, ghost town when bad.

**Key Landmarks:** Urban's Urbanium, The Chomp Plaza, Jort Junction, The Gator Gate.

## Rival Districts

**Vol Valley** – Eternal SEC blood feud. **Tidewater** – Grudging mutual respect. **The Bayou** – Authentic vs. performative swamp.

## Unspoken Truth

The gator chomp has become an unconscious tic. Urban's never coming back. The silence strategy (going quiet when losing) is survival, but it's also admission of fragility.
