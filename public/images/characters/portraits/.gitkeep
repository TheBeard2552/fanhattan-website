# Character Portraits Directory

Place character portrait images here using the naming convention: `{slug}.webp`

For example:
- `brown-bag-billy.webp`
- `ace-dillingham.webp`
- etc.

Recommended specs:
- Format: WebP
- Aspect ratio: 2:3 (portrait)
- Recommended size: 600x900px or 800x1200px
- Optimization: Use tools like Squoosh or cwebp for best compression

The character cards will automatically fall back to:
1. `/images/characters/portraits/{slug}.webp` (primary)
2. The `thumbnail` field from character frontmatter (secondary)
3. A generated placeholder with initials (final fallback)
